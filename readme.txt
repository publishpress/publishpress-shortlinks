## Automatically create shortlinks for your posts

PublishPress Shortlinks will automatically generate links for all your posts and pages. This makes it really easy to have shareable links for content. These shortlinks are available from the Posts screen and the Post Edit screen.

## Use your own website domain for shortlinks

There's no need to use an external service to build and track your links. With PublishPress Shortlinks, all your custom URLs use your own domain name. To avoid conflicts with any regular URLs on your site, there's also a folder which is set to "go" by default. This means that your custom URLs will look like this: https://example.com/go/shortlinks

## Customize the slug for each shortlink

Every post has its own URL. By default, the final part of the URL will be a unique combination of 5 characters, so your shortlink will look like this: https://example.com/go/8vi3n. However, you can customize the slug so it looks like this: https://example.com/go/shortlinks.

## Choose from 301, 302, and 307 redirects

Edit a shortlink and go to the "Redirection" tab. You can choose what kind of redirect is used for each link. 301 (Permanent) redirects are used to tell search engines that a requested URL has been permanently moved to another URL. If you're confident that your target URL will never change, then use this redirect type. 302 and 307 (Temporary) redirects tell search engines that the requested URL has been moved temporarily, but will be back eventually.
